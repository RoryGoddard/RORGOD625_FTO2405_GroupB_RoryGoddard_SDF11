# Project Overview
To create a beautiful and responsive website representing Cache Bank, a fictional bank catering specifically to developers.
Constructed with the "Mobile First" design approach, this website would display industry standard components such as a nav bar, 
hero section, statistics, contact section, footer, and more. The Stack used was HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript. 

# Installation

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server with live preview using Browsersync
npm run browsersync

```

# Challenges Faced 
I had a particularly hard time getting my tailwind installation to work properly. Certain custom files applied from the forked repo would not apply. 
In the end I solved this by moving my index.html to be within my src folder. I then would rebuild tailwind, and tailwind would now detect the 
new styles I would want to apply, adding them to my theme.css and theme.min.css.

Other than that, the project was an enjoyable experience to code up and I took my time to format everything exactly how I wanted it. 
I made multiple minimal changes to the design to the project either motivated by more semantic design choices, or to achieve an end result that I felt
would not only look good, but function as I would expect it to as a consumer.

# Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed this project and I am going into my next feeling more confident not only with my semantic HTML abilities, but also how to 
go into projects thinking about mobile first design princicples. Planning first to apply styles on mobile displays and then scaling this upwards
and outwards to larger displays. 

I now feel confident with my understanding of CSS properties to achieve this, with particular respect to responsive
CSS grids that can change their columns at various viewport widths. I have learnt a lot and I am excited to use my new mobile first and tailwind skills
to achieve even greater results in the projects ahead.
